						Your journey begins at the Awesome Shield learning website. Our step-by-step video series teach you about coding and Arduino. You write simple but real lines of code on your computer. Then, with the snap of a cable, and the click of a button, something amazing happens. The Arduino comes to life with light and sound. It uses its sensors to interact with you and the environment. Pretty soon you’re building projects, learning about science, math, and surprising yourself with what’s possible.

						The Awesomeness of Arduino, Without the Roadblocks
					</p>
					<p>
						We love Arduino. It’s one of the best ways to have fun with programming, electronics and science. There is nothing like seeing code you wrote coming alive in your hands. We want lots of people to have that experience. Unfortunately, it’s been hard for beginners to get started with Arduino – until now. We identified the three toughest things about learning Arduino, and made them way easier and more fun with Awesome Shield.
					</p>
					<p class="media">
						<img src="/img/campaign/KS-content---hardware-example.gif"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Hardware, without the headaches.</strong> It’s tough to learn how to build circuits on a breadboard and write code at the same time. There’s just so much that can wrong. Awesome Shield’s pre-assembled hardware lets you focus on the coding, which means you can learn faster and without the frustration. You get all the pleasure of seeing your code come to life without any of the hassle, and if you want to hook up a breadboard you can do it on your terms. 
					</p>
					<p class="media">
						<img src="/img/campaign/KS-content---code-example.gif"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Simple code you’ll enjoy learning.</strong> Arduino code is powerful, but tough for beginners to understand. It takes many lines of code to accomplish even basic things. That’s why we’ve simplified the Arduino code into easy to read “code sentences” using our Awesome Shield library. Our library comes with great documentation and helpful examples that explain how how to use the code.
					</p>	
					<p class="media">
						<img src="/img/campaign/KS-content---video-example.gif"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Step-by-step video series bring it all together.</strong> We’ll launch with 100+ awesome videos will teach you everything you need to know to get started with Arduino. Over 400 people have already learned with and loved our videos so we’re pretty sure you’ll love them too.

						We believe technology should be accessible to everyone. That’s why our hardware design and software library are open source, for all to see. We kept them both simple so that understanding them doesn’t require years of training. That means you can look under the hood and understand how Awesome Shield itself is made. It also means the hardware and software library can be used and improved by the community.

						FAQ					
					</h1>
					<p>
						<strong>
							How much will Awesome Shield cost? 
						</strong><br/>
							It’s looking like Awesome Shield kit (including hardware, videos, and code) will cost 48€. This may change slightly as we firm up the finances leading up to the launch date.					
					</p>					
					<p>
						<strong>
							What?!? There’s No Arduino in the Box? 
						</strong><br/>
							You are correct, we will send you the Awesome Shield hardware, but you will need to buy an Arduino yourself. It kills us too. Here’s the skinny: we’re a small company and we simply can’t afford to sell Arduinos along with the rest of the product. We’ve crunched the math 12 ways to tuesday, we’ve spoken to people smarter than ourselves, we’ve looked under every rock and agonized over this – but just couldn’t make it work in our base campaign. In the end, we decided it was better to deliver you the amazing Awesome Shield experience than have no campaign at all. 

					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>
							How much does an Arduino cost? 
						</strong><br/>
							Arduinos are very affordable, and come in many flavors. The Arduino Uno is a great starter Arduino, works beautifully with Awesome Shield and typically costs about $25 USD or 22 EUR.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>
							Will you send me some plug and play add-ons?
						</strong><br/>
							Not as part of this campaign. But you can purchase any of the 150+ amazing add-ons directly from <a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/category_products?themes_id=1417">Seeed Studios</a>. We plan to offer kits of add-ons in the future, along with more tutorials and super awesome projects that teach you how to use them – which will be a great opportunity to learn more advanced programming, science, and math concepts! Awesome Shield is built to grow with you. 
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>
							What makes it easier to learn?
						</strong><br/>
							Traditionally, you learn to code for Arduino and to build circuits at the same time. This is tough, because when there’s a problem, you don’t know if it’s in your code, or in your circuit. Awesome Shield solves this problem with pre-assembled hardware, so you can focus on your code. 
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>
							Is it safe?
						</strong><br/>
							Arduino microcontrollers operate at low voltage (5V). This is less than the amount of power produced by a 9V battery.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>
							Is it real code?
						</strong><br/>
							Awesome Shield teaches you to write real code, not use a graphical programming interface. This means that what you learn is deeply useful in any programming language. 
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>
							What programming language is the code in?
						</strong><br/>
							C++
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>
							What about setup?
						</strong><br/>
							Don’t sweat it – set up is easy. You’ll go to the Awesome Shield learning website, and find videos that walk you through the short setup process. 
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>
							What is grove?						
						</strong><br/>
							Awesome Shield is fully compatible with Grove Add-Ons. These components are a modular system of electronics components developed and manufactured by Seeed Studios.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>
							Which Arduino do I need?
						</strong><br/>
							Awesome Shield is fully compatible with many Arduino types, including the Uno R3, Mega, and Yun.
					</p>					
					<p>
						<strong>
							Is it hard to connect Awesome Shield and Arduino?
						</strong><br/>
							Nope. It snaps right on in seconds.
