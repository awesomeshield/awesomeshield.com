						Awesome Shield gives kids and the young at heart everything they need to get creative with Arduino and programming.  Our online video lessons, custom made hardware, and easy to understand code take you on an exciting learning journey of coding, science, math, and discovery. You’ll learn how to program the Arduino and create your own inventions, while creating your own inventions and solving puzzles.

					<p>
						Your journey begins at the Awesome Shield learning website. Our step-by-step video series teach you about coding and Arduino. You write simple but real lines of code on your computer. Then, with the snap of a cable, and the click of a button, something amazing happens. The Arduino comes to life with light and sound. It uses its sensors to interact with you and the environment. Pretty soon you’re building projects, learning about science, math, and surprising yourself with what’s possible.

						The Awesomeness of Arduino, Without the Roadblocks
					</p>
					<p>
						We love Arduino. It’s one of the best ways to have fun with programming, electronics and science. There is nothing like seeing code you wrote coming alive in your hands. We want lots of people to have that experience. Unfortunately, it’s been hard for beginners to get started with Arduino – until now. We identified the three toughest things about learning Arduino, and made them way easier and more fun with Awesome Shield.
					</p>
					<p class="media">
						<img src="/img/campaign/KS-content---hardware-example.gif"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Hardware, without the headaches.</strong> It’s tough to learn how to build circuits on a breadboard and write code at the same time. There’s just so much that can wrong. Awesome Shield’s pre-assembled hardware lets you focus on the coding, which means you can learn faster and without the frustration. You get all the pleasure of seeing your code come to life without any of the hassle, and if you want to hook up a breadboard you can do it on your terms. 
					</p>
					<p class="media">
						<img src="/img/campaign/KS-content---code-example.gif"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Simple code you’ll enjoy learning.</strong> Arduino code is powerful, but tough for beginners to understand. It takes many lines of code to accomplish even basic things. That’s why we’ve simplified the Arduino code into easy to read “code sentences” using our Awesome Shield library. Our library comes with great documentation and helpful examples that explain how how to use the code.
					</p>	
					<p class="media">
						<img src="/img/campaign/KS-content---video-example.gif"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Step-by-step video series bring it all together.</strong> We’ll launch with 100+ awesome videos will teach you everything you need to know to get started with Arduino. Over 400 people have already learned with and loved our videos so we’re pretty sure you’ll love them too.

						Beneath each Awesome Shield board sits the powerful Arduino platform. Awesome Shield is a standard Arduino Shield and uses the Arduino development tools (IDE) and library system. With these tools, you can build anything you can imagine. People have built some amazing things with Arduino. Awesome Shield puts you on the right path to join the amazing maker community or learn new programming languages (like Python, JavaScript, Java or Ruby).

						FAQ					
					</h1>
					<p>
						<strong>
							What?!? There’s No Arduino in the Box? 
						</strong><br/>
							You are correct, we will send you the Awesome Shield hardware, but you will need to buy an Arduino yourself. It kills us too. Here’s the skinny: we’re a small company and we simply can’t afford to sell Arduinos along with the rest of the product. We’ve crunched the math 12 ways to tuesday, we’ve spoken to people smarter than ourselves, we’ve looked under every rock and agonized over this – but just couldn’t make it work in our base campaign. In the end, we decided it was better to deliver you the amazing Awesome Shield experience than have no campaign at all. 
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>
							How much does an Arduino cost? 
						</strong><br/>
							Arduinos are very affordable, and come in many flavors. The Arduino Uno is a great starter Arduino, works beautifully with Awesome Shield and typically costs about $25 USD or 22 EUR. We recommend getting yours here: ___link___ .  
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>
							Will you send me some plug and play add-ons?
						</strong><br/>
							Not as part of this campaign. But you can purchase any of the _X_ amazing add-ons directly from Seeed Studios. We plan to offer kits of add-ons in the future, along with more tutorials and super awesome projects that teach you how to use them – which will be a great opportunity to learn more advanced programming, science, and math concepts! Awesome Shield is built to grow with you. 
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>
							What makes it easier to learn?
						</strong><br/>
							Not knowing where the bugs are - shield vs. breadboard.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>
							Is it safe?
						</strong><br/>
							Yes!
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>
							Is it real code?
						</strong><br/>
							Yes!
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>
							What about setup?
						</strong><br/>
							Yes!
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>
							Will Awesome Shield give me superpowers?
						</strong><br/>
							Yes!
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>
							What is grove?						
						</strong><br/>
						Yes!
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>
							Risks					
						</strong><br/>
						Yes!
